Description: Generates predicted stage change days for an insect, based on daily temperatures and development rate parameters, as developed by Pollard (2014) <http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/view/ethesisauthor/Pollard=3ACiaran_P=2E=3A=3A.html>. A few example datasets are included and implemented for P. vulgatissima, the blue willow beetle, but the approach can be readily applied to other species that display similar behaviour.
