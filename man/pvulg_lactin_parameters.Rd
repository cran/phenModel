\details{
The parameters were derived based on constant temperature laboratory experiments (see Pollard, 2014) for different life-cycle stages of P. vulgatissima. Development times were converted to rates and subsequently used as input for the Lactin model (Lactin et al., 1995). The model was fitted to the entire temperature range, including where there was no development rate (at the upper temperature threshold).
